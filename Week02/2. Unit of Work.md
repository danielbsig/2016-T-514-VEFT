# Unit of Work

Our business logic will probably need to access a few database tables. However, we would also like to be able to easily
write unit tests for the business logic. One way to achieve this is to use Unit of Work and the Repository pattern.

It must be stated that there are many different implementations of the Repository pattern available, and not everyone
agrees what it should really look like. There are also those which claim that it is not necessary at all.

The following articles explain the Repository pattern:

* [http://blog.longle.net/2013/05/11/genericizing-the-unit-of-work-pattern-repository-pattern-with-entity-framework-in-mvc/](http://blog.longle.net/2013/05/11/genericizing-the-unit-of-work-pattern-repository-pattern-with-entity-framework-in-mvc/)
* This one does actually explain it as well, although the title would indicate the author isn't fond of the pattern: [http://www.wekeroad.com/2014/03/04/repositories-and-unitofwork-are-not-a-good-idea/](http://www.wekeroad.com/2014/03/04/repositories-and-unitofwork-are-not-a-good-idea/)

In general, this is what it is all about:

* Create a generic IRepository interface, one table will map to exactly one repository.
* Create a IUnitOfWork interface, which is capable of returning a repository for a table, and takes care of committing changes to the database.
* Create concrete implementations of those interfaces.

Our business logic classes will have the following structure:

```c#
public class SomeServiceProvider
{
    private readonly IUnitOfWork _uow;
    private readonly IRepository<EntityClassA> _As;
    private readonly IRepository<EntityClassB> _Bs;

    public SomeServiceProvider(IUnitOfWork uow)
    {
        _uow = uow;
        _As = _uow.GetRepository<EntityClassA>();
        _Bs = _uow.GetRepository<EntityClassB>();
        // etc., depending on how many tables this service provider needs access to
    }

    public void SomeBusinessLogicMethod(int id)
    {
        // Use the .All() method to get access to all records
        // in a given table, which can then be filtered, depending on
        // what the method really needs - example:
        var result = _As.All().SingleOrDefault(x => x.ID = id);

        // Note: we will cover the syntax for the queries elsewhere in more detail
    }
}
```
Each service provider has access to a UnitOfWork through a constructor parameter, and stores that reference for future
use (which we will need when performing updates). In the constructor, it queries the Unit of work object for the
repositories it requires, and stores them in member variables (which can be marked as readonly, since they will be
set in the constructor and won't be written to after that).

## Command/Query Object Pattern

One alternative design pattern is called CQOP, or Command/Query Object Pattern. This design pattern is not that
different from the one described above, i.e. the business logic is kept in separate classes.
