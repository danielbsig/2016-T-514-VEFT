#Tracing

When we are trying to debug a application, there is no substitute for a good set of trace logs.
You can use this feature to trace what the Web API framework does before and after it invokes your controller. You can also use it to trace your own code.


##Default Tracing

To enable tracing using System.Diagnostics we will need to install [Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Tracing](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Tracing) which will install the latest Web API tracing package.

Now, to enable dafault tracing add the follwing code to the config in the WebApiConfig class:


```c#
public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)
{
	...
	SystemDiagnosticsTraceWriter traceWriter = config.EnableSystemDiagnosticsTracing();
	traceWriter.IsVerbose = true;
	traceWriter.MinimumLevel = TraceLevel.Debug;
	...
}
```

This code adds the [SystemDiagnosticsTraceWriter](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.http.tracing.systemdiagnosticstracewriter.aspx) class to the Web API pipeline. The SystemDiagnosticsTraceWriter class writes traces to System.Diagnostics.Trace.

If you run your application in the debugger and issue a request, the trace statements are written to the Output window in Visual Studio.

You may noticed in the code example above that the SystemDiagnosticsTraceWriter has two properties that allow you to control the settings:

* IsVerbose: If false, each trace contains minimal information. If true, traces include more information.
* MinimumLevel: Sets the minimum trace level. Trace levels, in order, are Debug, Info, Warn, Error, and Fatal.

##Add traces to your code

You can also use the trace writer to trace your own code, like this:

```c#
[HttpGet]
[Route("")]
public IEnumerable<LanguageViewModel> Get()
{
    Configuration.Services.GetTraceWriter().Info(Request, "Get", "Get the list of LanguageViewModel.");
    var languageViewModel = new LanguageViewModel
    {
        Description = Resources.Resources.Description,
        Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow,
        Name = Resources.Resources.Name
    };
    return new[] { languageViewModel };
}
```

##Creating Custom Trace Writer

Instead of using the SystemDiagnosticsTraceWriter class as the trace writer you can also create your own trace writer. To do so you need to create a class that implements the ITraceWriter interface and then implement its Trace() method. The following code shows how this is done:

```c#
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.Http.Tracing;

namespace CoursesAPI.Tracers
{
    public class CourseAPITracer : ITraceWriter
    {
        public void Trace(HttpRequestMessage request, string category, TraceLevel level,
            Action<TraceRecord> traceAction)
        {
            TraceRecord rec = new TraceRecord(request, category, level);
            traceAction(rec);
            WriteTrace(rec);
        }

        protected void WriteTrace(TraceRecord rec)
        {
            //Write to output
            var message = string.Format("{0};{1};{2}", rec.Operator, rec.Operation, rec.Message);            
            System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine(message, rec.Category);
            //Write to file
            string path = HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath("~/Logs/MyTestLog.txt");
            System.IO.File.AppendAllText(path, rec.Status + " - " + rec.Message + "\r\n");
            //Write using any logging technique that you like
            //...
        }
    }
}
```

To enable tracing, you must configure Web API to use your ITraceWriter implementation. You can do this by adding the following code to the Register method in the WebApiConfig class.

```c#
public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)
{
	...
	config.Services.Replace(typeof(ITraceWriter), new CourseAPITracer());
	...
}
...
```

As you can see the Register() method calls the Replace() method to replace the default trace writer service with an instance of CourseAPITracer.

Only one trace writer can be active. By default, Web API sets a "no-op" tracer that does nothing. (The "no-op" tracer exists so that tracing code does not have to check whether the trace writer is null before writing a trace.)
