# Security

This section will cover some of the most common security vulnerabilities web applications face, and what can be done to prevent them.

The [Open Web Application Security Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) has a lot of information about security issues in web applications. For instance, the [Top 10 list](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project#tab=OWASP_Top_10_for_2013) is very useful.

## SQL injection

SQL injection is probably the best known security issue in web development, partly due to [this XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/327/). In short, if an application uses input from users directly when constructing SQL commands, it allows the user to execute arbitrary commands. This could lead to data loss, sensitive data could end up in the hands of hackers, etc.

This topic has been covered a lot elsewhere. [This article is totally worth the read](https://www.troyhunt.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-sql/).

To prevent this from happening, ensure that you never concatenate SQL commands directly. Instead, use parameterized queries. When using the entity framework, this is mostly taken care of by the framework, but should be kept in mind nonetheless.

## Cross-site scripting

Cross-site scripting is when a page accepts input from a user, and renders the input directly on an HTML page. If the user adds input such as:

&lt;script&gt;alert("Im hacking your computer")%lt;/script%gt;

which would then be rendered as-is, then other users would execute this script. It this case, a simple alert() will not do any harm except for being annoying. However, the script could to all kinds of other things: read data from cookies/localStorage/etc. and send it to a hacker via an Ajax call, exploit know vulnerabilities in the browser of the user etc.

Web APIs usually don't worry too much about this, i.e. since this is mostly a matter of not rendering content from users directly, and this is usually done by the client application.

## CSRF (See-surf)

This vulnerability is probably the most relevant to Web API development. What happens is as follows:

* The user has already visited a page A which has a CSRF vulnerability
* The user visit another page B which tries to exploit that vulnerability
* Page B contains code which tries to issue a request to page A, thereby performing actions on behalf of the current user, without that user knowing about it.

Example:

* A teacher logs in to a Learning Management System (LMS) website (example: http://thelmswebsite.com) which uses cookies for authentication
* The teacher then visits www.some-hacking-website.com
* That site contains (hidden) code such as: $.ajax({method:'POST', url:'http://thelmswebsite.com/courses/12345/grades', data:{student:'123456789', grade:10}); - if the vulnerable endpoint is a GET endpoint, then the exploit could be a simple img tag which points to that endpoint
* Since the teacher had already logged into http://thelmswebsite.com, the browser will happily attach the cookie it had already obtained from that site to the request
* If the method being called allows requests to be issued from any origin, then the hacker may have tricked the teacher into giving the student with ID '123456789' the grade 10 in the course '12345'.

There are a few things which can be done to prevent this:

* Only allow requests from a known list of domains when configuring CORS (which may not be enough!)
* Add a special CSRF Token to GET requests, which would then be checked when POST/PUT/etc. requests are issued.



## Broken Authentication and Session Management
Broken Authentication and Session Management is when application functions that are related to authentication and session  management are not implemented like it should be implemented. 
That can allow attackers to get hold of passwords, keys, session tokens or find other implementation flaws that could guide the attacker to other users identities.

* Exploitability: Average
* Prevalence: Widespread
* Detectability: EAverage
* Impact: Servere

[According to OWASP top 10 2013](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A2-Broken_Authentication_and_Session_Management)

# What can you do to prevent this?
To prevent this the developer should follow the authentication and session management requirements defined in OWAS´s  
[Application Security Verification Standard](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS) 
(Chapter V2: AUTHENTICATION VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS and Chapter V3: SESSION MANAGEMENT VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS)

You should also try to avoid Cross Side Scripting flaw as they can be used to steal session IDs. 

# Examples: 
Airlines application support URL rewriting(implementing URL mapping or routing within a web application), putting session ID in the 

URL: http://someairlinecompany.com/blackfridaysale/saleitems?sessionid=113171894&dest=LosAngeles

The user that is authenticated emails his friend the link above to tell him about this amazing deal. What he doesn’t know is that he is also giving away his session ID. When his friend opens the link he will use his session and credit card information. 

Another scenario is if this user is on a public computer. The user closes the browser tab and someone else goes to the computer. If the application’s timeout is not set properly an attacker that uses the same browser and goes to the same website is still authenticated.
