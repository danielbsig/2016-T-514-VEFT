# Security

This section will cover some of the most common security vulnerabilities web applications face, and what can be done to prevent them.

The [Open Web Application Security Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) has a lot of information about security issues in web applications. For instance, the [Top 10 list](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project#tab=OWASP_Top_10_for_2013) is very useful.

## SQL injection

SQL injection is probably the best known security issue in web development, partly due to [this XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/327/). In short, if an application uses input from users directly when constructing SQL commands, it allows the user to execute arbitrary commands. This could lead to data loss, sensitive data could end up in the hands of hackers, etc.

This topic has been covered a lot elsewhere. [This article is totally worth the read](https://www.troyhunt.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-sql/).

To prevent this from happening, ensure that you never concatenate SQL commands directly. Instead, use parameterized queries. When using the entity framework, this is mostly taken care of by the framework, but should be kept in mind nonetheless.

## Cross-site scripting

Cross-site scripting is when a page accepts input from a user, and renders the input directly on an HTML page. If the user adds input such as:

&lt;script&gt;alert("Im hacking your computer")%lt;/script%gt;

which would then be rendered as-is, then other users would execute this script. It this case, a simple alert() will not do any harm except for being annoying. However, the script could to all kinds of other things: read data from cookies/localStorage/etc. and send it to a hacker via an Ajax call, exploit know vulnerabilities in the browser of the user etc.

Web APIs usually don't worry too much about this, i.e. since this is mostly a matter of not rendering content from users directly, and this is usually done by the client application.

## CSRF (See-surf)

This vulnerability is probably the most relevant to Web API development. What happens is as follows:

* The user has already visited a page A which has a CSRF vulnerability
* The user visit another page B which tries to exploit that vulnerability
* Page B contains code which tries to issue a request to page A, thereby performing actions on behalf of the current user, without that user knowing about it.

Example:

* A teacher logs in to a Learning Management System (LMS) website (example: http://thelmswebsite.com) which uses cookies for authentication
* The teacher then visits www.some-hacking-website.com
* That site contains (hidden) code such as: $.ajax({method:'POST', url:'http://thelmswebsite.com/courses/12345/grades', data:{student:'123456789', grade:10}); - if the vulnerable endpoint is a GET endpoint, then the exploit could be a simple img tag which points to that endpoint
* Since the teacher had already logged into http://thelmswebsite.com, the browser will happily attach the cookie it had already obtained from that site to the request
* If the method being called allows requests to be issued from any origin, then the hacker may have tricked the teacher into giving the student with ID '123456789' the grade 10 in the course '12345'.

There are a few things which can be done to prevent this:

* Only allow requests from a known list of domains when configuring CORS (which may not be enough!)
* Add a special CSRF Token to GET requests, which would then be checked when POST/PUT/etc. requests are issued.
